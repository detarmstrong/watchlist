### Requirements

* WatchList is tested on Mac and Linux, but because it's Java it should work on Windows too.
* Works with Redmine 2.5.0 and above.

## How/Why

WatchList only requires your Redmine URL and your user API key. Select custom criteria for issues updates you want to see. Criteria go beyond the native Redmine email updates by enabling you to:

* Watch updates for issues related to any of your assigned issues
* Watch updates for issues where you've participated in the history of updates
* Watch all issue updates for specific projects

WatchList starts by grabbing the last 3 days worth of updates.

## Use It Now

1. Download app: [Latest Release](https://github.com/detarmstrong/watchlist/releases/latest)
1. Then from the command-line run:
```java -jar Downloads/watchlist-<version>-standalone.jar```
