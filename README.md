Get project issue updates that matter to you most in a desktop based news feed.

WatchList is tested on Mac and Linux, and because it's Java should work on Windows too.

### How/Why

WatchList only requires your Redmine URL and your user API key. Select custom criteria for issues updates you want to see. Criteria go beyond the native Redmine email updates by enabling you to:

* Watch updates for issues related to any of your assigned issues
* Watch updates for issues where you've participated in the history of updates 
* Watch all issue updates for specific projects

WatchList starts by grabbing the last 3 days worth of updates.

## Usage

Download app: <latest release>

Then from the command-line run:
java -jar <latest release jar file>
