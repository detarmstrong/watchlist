WatchList is tested on Mac and Linux, but because it's Java should work on Windows too.

### How

WatchList only requires your local Redmine instance url and your user api key. Next, select custom criteria for issues updates you want to see. Criteria go beyond the native Redmine email updates by enabling you to watch updates for issues related to any of your assigned issues, and issues where you've participated in the history of updates or even any update for specific projects. WatchList starts by grabbing the last 3 days worth of updates.

## Usage

Download app: [Latest Release](https://github.com/detarmstrong/watchlist/releases/download/0.9.0/watchlist-0.9.0-standalone.jar)

Then from the command-line run:
java -jar Downloads/watchlist-0.9.0-standalone.jar
